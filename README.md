# upper_confidence_bound-reinforcement_learning
## Description
This project implements the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm to solve the multi-armed bandit problem, specifically applied to optimize ad selection. The goal is to maximize the click-through rate (CTR) by dynamically selecting ads that perform best over time based on user interactions.

## Dataset
The dataset used is `Ads_CTR_Optimisation.csv`, where each row represents a user's interaction with different ads. Each value in the dataset is binary (1 or 0), indicating whether an ad was clicked or not during a particular round.

## Languages or Tools
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

## Libraries
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `math`

## Algorithm Overview
The Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm is a solution for the multi-armed bandit problem. It balances exploration (trying out different ads) and exploitation (focusing on the ads that are known to perform well) by selecting ads with the highest potential reward based on previous observations and uncertainty estimates.
